gystar
======

An _experimental_ project to get started with GitHub API (using PyGithub). Expect anything to be (or become) broken at any stage, since this is meant for the purpose of me learning things.

I was thinking that the number of my the repos I've starred is getting too high (271 at the moment), so I thought of a solution, and it's to have a program that exports the currently starred repos into a gist file. Later on, I might extend it if I see more need.

### What's with the name?!
basically, gystar = python + gist + star
